## 2026-10-05 — Project setup
- Context: Claude Code project initialized with `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md` (spec Section 12 verbatim), and MCP config.
- Decision: Configure GitHub and Vercel MCPs only. Supabase is not configured, per spec D6 and 15.1.
- Reason: The plan uses no database; connecting one adds risk and a pausing free tier.
- Spec sections affected: none.

## 2026-10-05 — GitHub access via gh CLI instead of GitHub MCP
- Context: Spec H6 suggests a fine-grained PAT scoped to one repo for the GitHub MCP.
- Decision: Use `git` + `gh` CLI with the owner's existing login. GitHub MCP removed from `.mcp.json`.
- Reason: Owner's choice; simpler. Risk: the login has `repo`/`workflow` scope on all the owner's repos, so the agent rule is to touch only `nivesh22/greenwindow`.
- Spec sections affected: 15.2 H6, 15.3.
